# Lem-in
Lem-in is an anthill simulator where each ant has to go from an entry to an out the fastest way(in the least steps) possible.

After testing a Djikstra-like algorithm, but deceived by its preformances, we turned to a modified Edmunds-Karp (Ford-Fulkerson with bfs) for it.

This 42 project was made in group with Ayguillo.
